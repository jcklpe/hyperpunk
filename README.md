## Install

Add `hyperpunk2.0` to the plugins list in your `~/.hyper.js` config file, and set you background color to transparent.

Tip: I recommend using the [AHAMONO](http://freebiesbug.com/free-fonts/ahamono-free-font/) font together with this theme. (That's Andre's suggestion. I personally use [Fura Code Powerline](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode))



## The Future

This project began as a theme plugin for hyper1.x by  [Andre Staltz](https://staltz.com) . I liked the theme and made a partial fix for it when the switch to Hyper2 and xterm.js implementation of 2D canvas broke the original theme. [I made a pull request](https://github.com/staltz/hyperpunk/pull/11) but it never got accepted so I decided that I might as well fork it and keep working on it! I'm a designer learning how to develop, and I 😎 Have 😎 No 😎 Clue 😎 What 😎 I'm 😎 Doing! So I'm treating this as a little bit of a learning project?



### Feature Goals:

* Looping mp4 backgrounds (maybe more efficient than brute changing the background texture via css/js maybe?)
* Shaders! I want to get those glowy glitchy letters back. (like [hyperprocessing](https://github.com/slammayjammay/hyper-postprocessing) or [hyperatompunk](https://github.com/cakenggt/hyperatompunk) have done)
